# Statistical-Analysis--Python
Statistical Analysis of transaction dataset using Python and creating a GUI in tkinter
In this project, we were tasked with developing a module for retrieving data from
transaction datasets and computing basic statistics on user transactions. The project involved three
main tasks: processing transaction datasets, computing the distance between any two transactions
of any user, and computing user transaction statistics. In this report, we will discuss our
implementation processes, decisions, justifications, and reflection on our experience while executing
this project.
